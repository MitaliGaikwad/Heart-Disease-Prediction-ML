# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
### By Mitali Gaikwad

**Objective:**  
Predict heart disease presence using machine learning models trained on the UCI dataset.

**Tools & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**Models Used:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier  
**Best Model:** Random Forest (Accuracy: 85%)

**Key Steps:**  
- Data cleaning & handling missing values  
- Feature scaling & EDA with visualizations  
- Model training and evaluation using F1-score and confusion matrix  

**Outcome:**  
The Random Forest model achieved ~85% accuracy in predicting heart disease risk.  
**Future Scope:** Hyperparameter tuning and model deployment via Streamlit or Flask.
